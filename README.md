# startup
This is a repository for my start-up project from CS260 (Web Development)

First change from my development environment! 
(Going to just call it VS Code from now on because that's what I'm using and it's less typing)

This was added from Github!

Another line added from VS Code and GitHub

###### Notes from the GitHub Assignment----
```
I learned about the git commands to bring new files or changes from GitHub to VS Code such as:
    > git pull
    > git commit
    >    This has a few extra things that can be added to it:
    >    -a automatically stages every changed and tracked file
    >    -m adds a message to the commit (good for keeping track of what my commits do)
    > git fetch
    > git status
    > git push

I think that git status is very helpful because I can see what changes I'm bringing into my development environment before actually bringing them in
